## Welcome To Musicians and Instruments!

* This is a passion project I have been working on to add React to a Rails project.  

* The main purpose of this app is to make scheduling musicians easier for my church worship band

* Problem Statement:
  * We have several musicians that play several instruments
  * We need a full band of musicians to play every Sunday (Guitar, Bass, Drums, Piano, Acoustic Guitar and Vocals)
  * We also want to make sure everyone gets to play
  * Everyone has different schedules each month and it can be hard to coordinate


* Purposed Solutions:
  * Create an interface where musicians can log in each month and add their availability for the upcoming month
  * Create a dashboard that allows the band leader to log in and schedule musicians based on their availability


* Future Plans:
  * Automate the emails that have to be manually created each month by the leader
  * Create an interface where the leader can add youtube links for the musicians to practice to
  * Create a Charts dashboard where the leader can add leadsheets and the musicians can find in the needed keys.  These are typically PDFs that comes from a service that the church pays for (we aren't pirating music)
  * Add authentication and authorization via Google OAuth so random people can't log in and disrupt our app

* Futher Notes:
  * This is mostly a learning exercise that may never be used or see the light of day  
  * There is no intention of using this for any monetary or personal gain, other than my own personal studies
